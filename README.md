DBVC - Database version control
-------------------------------

## Configuration

DBVC looks for the `dbvc.json` configuration file.

    {
      "db": {
        "driver": "mysql",
        "host": "localhost",
        "username": "root",
        "password": "open",
        "dbname": "foobar"
      },
      "datadir": "dev",
      "vcs": "none"
    }

If `datadir` is omitted, it defaults to "dev". If `vcs` is omitted, the vcs is automatically determined.

### Supported database interfaces

  * mysql

You may [issue a feature request](https://github.com/jasny/dbvc/issues) to support other DBMSs.

### Supported version control systems

  * git
  * none

You may [issue a feature request](https://github.com/jasny/dbvc/issues) to support other VCSs.

When selecting 'none', updates are run in [natural order](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.natsort.php). It's up to
you to prefix the update files with (for instance) a date, to make sure that run in the correct order
